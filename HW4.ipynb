Your IPython Notebooks should be completely executed with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code. Compress the folder (please use .zip compression) and submit to the CS109 dropbox in the appropriate folder. If we cannot access your work because these directions are not followed correctly, we will not grade your work. For the competition (problem 4), we will post a link on Piazza to a Google Form for you to submit your predictions. \n",
